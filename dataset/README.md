# Dataset origin
This repository contains a fork of the Molecule3D dataset originally curated by Xu et al. in [Molecule3D: A Benchmark for Predicting 3D Geometries from Molecular Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01717), licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0). In this fork, molecules containing single atoms and those with two non-interacting atoms have been removed to improve data quality. Molecular representations including SMILES strings were computed using [RDKit](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit), SELFIES representations using the [SELFIES](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/selfies) library, and molecular symmetry groups were computed using the [SOFI](https://github.com/mammasmias/IterativeRotationsAssignments) libraries.
