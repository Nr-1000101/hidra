This repository contains a fork of the Molecule3D dataset originally curated by Xu et al. in Molecule3D: A Benchmark for Predicting 3D Geometries from Molecular Graphs, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0). In this fork, molecules containing single atoms and those with two non-interacting atoms have been removed to improve data quality. Molecular representations including SMILES strings were computed using RDKit, SELFIES representations using the SELFIES library, and molecular symmetry groups were computed using the SOFI libraries.
